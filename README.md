# Implementation of Source Coding and Channel Coding Algorithms

In this project, we were required to implement different source coding algorithms like Huffman Coding, Lempel-Ziv, and Run Length Encoding to reduce the redundancy in a given test image.

We also were required to model a binary symmetric channel in code and pass the image under different error probabilities of the channel to observe the results. Later, we had to devise a channel coding scheme for efficient transmission of the image through this channel.
